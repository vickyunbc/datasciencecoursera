### Now we will read the training and testing data from 
### UCI HAR Dataset

### UCI HAR Dataset contain "activity_labels.txt", "features.txt", features.txt
### README.txt, directories test and train
### README.txt have all information about what is present in test and train data

### Now Reading the testing data with same variables. This is done from lines 30-32. 
### Lines 39-48 are for nameing the columns of training and testing data

### The Step 1 of the assignment is done on lines 53-56. Step 2 is on lines 59-62. The final step is on lines 70-7
